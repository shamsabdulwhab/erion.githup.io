                          Before I start this semester, I set goals in both profesional and technical skills especially the profesional skills cause I realised their importance and I have weaknesses in this part more than in technical part.

                   <h4>Action</h4>I do my best to attend everyday to schools for a purpose of integration with my friends and to work with groups.
                   We had nice talk and did the tasks together as an example for this : CoCacola presentation

                        <h3>UX and Psychology class</h3>
                            In third week we had UX and Psychology lecture. This lecture was clear for me.I was excited to participate for the lecture task which was
                            "Per each principle make a little research and find a good corresponding example
                            on a random website. Screenshot your findings and enclose them in a small
                            presentation." I noticed when I started my presentation I forgot what I want to explain due to public speaking anxiety.
                                That day I just prepared 2 hour.
                                 I knew myself that I have to prepare to the presentation alot to feel confident ,otherwise the language barrier and lack of preparation affects on my presentation in case I didn't prepare, 
                                 and affects on the explaination of what I want to deliver. </p>

                            <p> I asked my friends after my presentation about how I was. 
                                   After We finished the class I talked with the teacher one-one talk.
                                   The teacher feedback was It would be better next time if I write note on the Powerpoint in case of forget [ex: as a hook]
                                  I was told also that presentation without preparation requires a specific level.</p>

                        <p> <br> In order to provide a visual and interactive medium for communicating design ideas and concepts, we have made a video script. Our group video was good but it missed the art of acting. We presented the features and benefits of our design without showing the visuals like the website, products and benefits.</p>

                        <p> I was the responsible person for conducting A/B testing on the prototype.I defined the elements to test. I created two different type of layouts. Sometimes I created more than two but I make sure that there are no big differences between tested layouts. Then I went the public library and test that on the audience. 
                          I documented while the audience were testing the prototype. 
                          Finally I implemented these changes based on the findings. Our goal for AB testing is to optimize the design based on user feedback and improve the overall user experience.

              <h3>Statement</h3>
              <p>In the eighth week, I finished missed parts in the research document.We divided also another tasks for each group member, and I was responsible for creating the project statement.
                We talke with the teacher and updated him. He suggested we talk to Erion and share some of the findings of our
                research with him.
                - Each group member was given a set of task to finish over the weekend: <br>
                    * Ana - coming up with the manifesto <br>
                    * Shams - coming up with the project statement <br>
                    * Alexandra - coming up with the Moscow list and setting up a meeting with Erion. <br>
                    * Shams - Finish research document <br>
                    * Katerina - Adding documents to git  <br>
                    * Ivana - Updating README file <br>
                 Here is the research document that I came up with it: <br>

                      <br>
                        <p> <strong>First:</strong>After everygroup memeber showed its own prototype.We discussed which design we will use from every member. EX: we used header and footer of Ivana. Exibition-page we inspired from Alexandra. From my prototype we took the wireframe and gallery-page. <strong>Second:Create Low-Fidelity Wireframes.</strong> I've learned  that low-fidelity is  quick sketches that focus on layout and structure rather than visual design. 
                          They help to visualize the overall page structure and the placement of various elements.
                           Its important that Instead of using actual content, I can use placeholder text such as "Lorem ipsum" or simple descriptive phrases to represent the general content structure. This helps convey the idea without getting caught up in the specifics of the text.

                          <p> <strong>Finally</strong> After we finished the low fidelity prototype, we sat down together and started doing the interactive high fidelity prototype. 
                            While we were making the prototype we were challenged to  incorporate two different ideas, sometimes we had two different opinions. 
                            Solutions: We ask people who aren't in our group, see which layout they like, and use that layout.
                            We can't satisfy the group member as a whole when we can't implement two different features(headers)  for the sake of consistency. <br></p>
