                          We interviewed our client, which was a critical part of our research.
                           We wanted to understand his needs and preferences because they were our top priority.
                            The interview lasted half an hour. We used an empathy map to capture his feelings, needs, and desires.</p>

                     <p>I made a survey quesyions in Microsoft from. 
                        <br> But someone in our group changed the questions suddenly without letting us know . when we knew the group leader decided to make a new survey on his PC so  no one can change the questions again.
                        I understood what happened but here is the survey that I have made it  : <a href="https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=ZWdrxpS3K0qE7YRbNBwIauZMn7uXAJdAnSaBlui7KgBUNFJZMkoxTUMwRlAzVEk3UzdDU0RXQ00zVC4u "> click here <br></a>

                        <h2>ASK THE EXPERT</h2>
                        <P>After we prepared the survey questions we wanted to make the survey questions as quick as we could  and simple and sufficient. 
                            we wanted also to  phrase questions that are suitable in a survey.. In order to do that we asked Amer he was in canvas that day afternoon.
                            <p> <strong><br> the teacher feedback:</strong> we had some questions that say on a scale from 1-10 and that was cofusing a little. The teacher adviced us to use a global scale  for an example : 
                                <ul>
                                     fully agree - agree - neutral - disagree - strongly disagree
                                </ul>
        
        
                                <p><strong>  The teacher notes:</strong>
                                <ul> we've been told that we could go to galleris and muesums in Amesterdam
                                     Amer adviced us to talk with elderly people who are interested in art and have time usually 
                                     Amer told us to seize the apportunity if we met people who are so friendly and ask them if they can do the interview with us and that what I did after
                                </ul></p>
                                
                    
                           <p>After we prepared the survey questions.We splited our group into three teams each team consist of 2 people. Each 2 members should collect at least 20 responses to the survey. I Personelly went to Rembrandt gallery in Eindhoven and Van Abbemuseum. First I went to the art Rembrandt galley with Ivana. There we have met the owner and he was so friendly so that we asked him if he has time to do the interview with us , and he agreed. 
                         <br> Second place was Rembrandt gallery. There we met alot of art enthusiast people from different countries. I printed 20 papers and we collected around 24 responses. People there were so willing to help because we ran out of the papers we decided to go home. </p>

                        <li>Conduct two interviews with two stakeholders</li>
                        <p>As mentioned before when we were conducting the survey, many people they were willing to help and no one rejected to help with the survey. Coming to the interview some people they they didnt have time so that we didnt asked them. People who were so friendly and liked talking with us we took their contact details to conduct interview with them.
                             We asked specificlly people who has a different background and different interests in art. 
                              The first interview was with Jan the art gallery owner. I insisted to make interview with this man cause he was an artists and he sell , buy arts every week.
                               He has made a very creative collections in his gallery.
                              On the other hand, the second interview me and Ivana conducted with two Italian guys who were artists but not so profesionals. They just started and start up company.

                              <p>Before the presentation we prepared a research document. We actually spend one whole day in Fontys writing the search document. I helped my friend on <strong>Competitor Analysis</strong> . We wrote how which art website we searched for. We were inspired with some ideas from online art website and what the stakeholder liked from these ideas.</p>
                              <h3>Prepare for the presentaion on sixth April</h3> <p>after we finished the research document we had a presentation next day. We got a feedback from the teacher that we should explained how the results affects on our research. the teacher mentioned also that we should prepared the presentation before many times.</p>

                                I tried to bridge the points of our group cause I dont have any problem with any member. 
                                Everyone in the group should do his best couse if someone doesnt help that will affect the whole group. </p>

                                  Our teacher (Amer) adviced us to give three chances for everyone if he doesnt come to school and doesnt have excuse. So if anyone doesnt come and doesnt tell the group we give warning.
                                  If he does that three times then we speak to the teacher. I created  an excel document for that. <br>

                                    <p>One of our group member has decided to drop out of our group and retake the semester.
                                       He was suppose to code the whole page of biography .
                                       He didn't inform us earlier. We just found out the day before the deadline. 
                                       We  intend to finish our assignment and hand in all the deliverables within the deadlines.</p>
                                       <p><strong>  <br> Actions:</strong></p>
                                       <p>I took the initiative to code the biography page that was originally assigned to the absent team member, ensuring that our assignment could be completed and delivered on time.</p>
                                       <p><strong> <br> I have learned from this experience </strong></p>
                                       <p>This experience showed me the importance of being flexible, taking responsibility for tasks, and being ready to handle unexpected challenges that may come up. 
                                        It reminded me how crucial it is to communicate clearly and address problems promptly to keep the project on track and meet deadlines successfully.</p>   

                                         <p> <br> Below, you can find the part of the project that I worked on during the final days. This includes both my assigned tasks which was the header , footer, and the gallery page, and the tasks originally designated for my friend who dropped out which is (the biography page). <br></p>
