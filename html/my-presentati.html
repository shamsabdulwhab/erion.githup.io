         <!-- <h3> On this page I am going to explain my goals, What skills do I want to acquire, and the actions I took to reach the goals.</h3>
                    Before I start this semester, I set goals in both profesional and technical skills especially the profesional skills cause I realised their importance and I have weaknesses in this part more than in technical part. 
              <P>
                 <strong>What are the taking actions to strengthen that part:</strong>
                </P> 
             <h4>Action1</h4>I do my best to attend everyday to schools for a purpose of integration with my friends and to work with groups.
             We had nice talk and did the tasks together as an example for this : CoCacola presentation

                <P> 
                    <strong> <br> Strengthen poor presentation</strong>
                </P> 
                <p>Develop my soft-skills :I need to be honest with myself in order to determine my weaknesses. 
                    I knew before that my presenting are not that much. So I had a goal to develop this part </p>
                I dont forget UX and Psychology class:
                In third week we had UX and Psychology lecture. This lecture was clear for me.I was excited to participate for the lecture task which was
                "Per each principle make a little research and find a good corresponding example
                on a random website. Screenshot your findings and enclose them in a small
                presentation." 
                <p>Here is my presentation:</p>
                
                <video  controls >
                    <source src="../images/videos/ux-psychology.mp4"  type="video/mp4"></video>
                <p>
                    I noticed when I started my presentation I forgot what I want to explain due to public speaking anxiety.
                That day I just prepared 2 hour.
                 I knew myself that I have to prepare to the presentation alot to feel confident ,otherwise the language barrier and lack of preparation affects on my presentation in case I didn't prepare, 
                 and affects on the explaination of what I want to deliver. 

                
                <p><strong>The Feeddback:</strong> </p>
                I asked my friends after my presentation about how I was. After We finished the class I talked with the teacher one-one talk.The teacher feedback was It would be better next time if I write note on the Powerpoint in case of forget [ex: as a hook]
                I was told also that presentation without preparation requires a specific level.
                </p>
