            <h4>The explaination </h4>
            <p>This poster was the first assignment.we had to explain three bad sites and three good sites from each person point of view . I also explained how I see myself as UCD designer    </p>
            <section class="explanation-one">
                <h4>How I see myself as a UCD designer?</h4>
                <p>Although I am more interested in front-end and coding topics more, but when considering UCD topics. I see it as design-centric and requires patienceand  users' understanding .
                    I guess I'd have to do a lot of research to know the user, and the difficulty at this point is knowing what the users feels and needs, even if they don't give us clear answers in the user interview. 
                    I think this stage will make me nervous because I understand that there are things that will be thrown away, things that will be modified and things that will be replaced.
                    I understand that working as a UCD is not the same as a linear process. So after each stage, I need to redefine and reasses my goals and assumptions.
                    The other stages depend more on my creativity, how will I translate the requirements of the user's needs into a great design. And It is interesting  because I'm the person who pays attention to the details </p>

                   <h4>The Three Bad Website</h4>
                   <p><strong>Selling & renting website:</strong> <a href="https://www.lingscars.com">https://www.lingscars.com  </a>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; When you enter this site, you will be a little surprised because of the colors and pictures it contains. 
                    There are also songs whose language I do not know. It works automatically. 
                    This site is for a Chinese person who lives in the United Kingdom, and he knows very well how to earn a lot of money from this site!.
                    The service he provides on this site is selling and renting cars ".
                   <br> But despite all this money, can anyone convince this person to hire a good designer or change the look of his site?</p>
                   <p><strong>Woonbedrijf website and recipe website:</strong> <a href="https://www.woonbedrijf.com">https://www.woonbedrijf.com</a>  &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="websitehttps://www.justfood.tv">websitehttps://www.justfood.tv</a> <br>
                     This website is for a housing company. I am using this website and I dont like it cause it is only in dutch . I dont know if there is an obtion for users to change the language and I always use the google translation. 
                    And the reason that I dont like the recipe website is the website colors.

                <h4>The Three Good Website</h4>
                <p>As an examples for good websites are  Amazon, Shein booking.com .
                    Their design is organized and efficient.It is easy to find your needs by one click. 
                    I dont have to click 100 clicks to find what I need. They shows its recommendations based on previous search results.These three websites make online shopping so exciting. In addition, their bright colors were chosed for a purpose.
