    <p>Here I am going to attach whole process of my portfolio prortotype , 
      starting with small steps "sketches" until the final compelete model </p>

                  <h3>logo design process <br><br> </h3>
                  <p><Strong>First,   </Strong>I wanted my logo to be motivational, funny, minimalistic..I went through many steps. You can see those steps from the picture up. 
                    I've started with drawing a tree and my name. My logo  has two basics part "name&tree". After I showed the teacher the logo. I was told to try to combine the two seperated parts into one merged logo.
                  
                      <strong>Then,</strong> I changed the logo cause I didn't know why I chose a tree draw. The reason is just that I like it.
                  
                   My second version I tried to make  it meaningful for example: I've chosen a logo with 2 parts(my name,and sun draw). I chose the sun cause my name means sun.
                    <strong>Feedback:</strong> When I show the logo to the teacher. I was told that the most part of my logo on one side and the other side was empty.

                   <strong>  <br> Finally:</strong> I chose just S&H letters. My last version logo contains from just two alphabets.
                    I felt the logo are symetric on this shape and I added music sign<i class="fa-solid fa-music"></i>.The music is an essential part of my character and I wanted my logo to represent simplicity , motivation ,and energy. 
                    <br>
              </p>

                <p>I used to do the prototype with Figma. This time I made the prototype with adobe xd. I use adobe xd to learn how to use and I wanted to use something new. 
                  Then I decided to do my portfolio again in Figma cause I feel comfortable with figma more. The video down shows what I have did in Adobe XD

          <p> We created a visually appealing layout for a newspaper. 
            In the beginning we inspired from the other newspapers examples at class.
             We made a plan for how we structured the layout and we take the margin in consideration.

          <h3> StoryTelling activity <br> <br> </h3>
          <p>On June 5th, we discovered that storytelling is a skill that improves as we dedicate time and effort to practice. 
            To enhance our storytelling abilities, we engaged in a group activity during our class. 
            We participated in a delightful exercise that consisted of three key events: the beginning(A guy gets shot), middle(A flight starts in a bar), and end(The police is running to the bar). 
             Interestingly, altering these events can completely transform the narrative we create.
